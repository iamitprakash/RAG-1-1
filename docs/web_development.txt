Web Development Essentials

Web development involves creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It encompasses both frontend and backend development.

Frontend Development:

Frontend development focuses on the user interface and user experience. Key technologies include:
- HTML: Markup language for structuring web content
- CSS: Styling language for designing web pages
- JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity

Modern frontend frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular have simplified building complex user interfaces. These frameworks use component-based architectures and enable efficient state management.

Backend Development:

Backend development handles server-side logic, database interactions, and API creation. Common technologies include:
- Node.js for JavaScript-based servers
- Python with Django or Flask
- Java with Spring Framework
- Ruby on Rails

RESTful APIs:

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. They enable communication between frontend and backend systems.

Security Considerations:

Web security is paramount. Developers must protect against:
- SQL injection attacks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities

Best Practices:

Modern web development emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and following web standards. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine web and mobile app features, providing enhanced user experiences.
